    <div class="about-me-box">

        <h3 class="text-style"> Hi, my name is Kalina Monova. I am a second-year studying 
            Computer Science and Behavioral Neuroscience at Northeastern University. 
            Driven by my passion for exploring the intersection of these fields. 
            I am particularly interested in computational biology and bioinformatics, 
            where I hope to leverage my skills to contribute to research and innovative solutions. 

            I am also interested in software engineering and web development roles. I enjoy  
        front-end and the creative aspects as well as the more techincal, problem solving aspects of
        back-end. 
    In my free time I like going to the gym, running and reading.  </h3>
